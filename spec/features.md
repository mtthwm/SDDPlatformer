- This app is a basic 2D platformer game.
- The game should be tile-based.
- The player controls one character which can move left and right, as well as jump.
- When the game is started, the player should be presented with a basic game world.
- Game worlds can be defined using a PNG image where specific hex codes identify tiles
- Mapping between hex values and tiles are done in a JSON document
- Tiles should have the following properties:
    - Solid (boolean) - whether the player collides with them or not
    - Image Path (string) - a path to the image to be used for the tile sprite
