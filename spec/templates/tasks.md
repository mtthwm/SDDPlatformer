Give me a list of of tasks for developing an application described by the following text. Avoid adding features not defined here.

%features.md%

While planning out these features, please keep the following rules in mind:

%rules.md%

Split tasks into two following categories: 1. Tasks that can be completed entirely within the code editor and 2. Tasks that require external changes, like running commands or dealing with the file structure.

Don't make the tasks overly granular.

Task lists should follow this structure:

- SYSTEM NAME | TASK NAME | TASK DESCRIPTION
- SYSTEM NAME | TASK NAME | TASK DESCRIPTION
