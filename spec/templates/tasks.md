Give me a list of of tasks for developing an application described by the following text. Avoid adding features not defined here.

%features.md%

While planning out these features, please keep the following rules in mind:

%rules.md%

Split tasks into two following categories: 1. Tasks that can be completed entirely within the code editor and 2. Tasks that require external changes, like running commands or dealing with the file structure. Tasks in group 2 should be listed first, then those in group 1

Tasks should be a broad overview, not a line-by-line explanation.

Task lists should follow this structure:

# External Tasks

- TASK DESCRIPTION
- TASK DESCRIPTION

--- 

# Coding Tasks

- SYSTEM NAME | TASK NAME | TASK DESCRIPTION
- SYSTEM NAME | TASK NAME | TASK DESCRIPTION
